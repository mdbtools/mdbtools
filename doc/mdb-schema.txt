NAME
  mdb-schema - Generate schema creation DDL
SYNOPSIS
  mdb-schema [options] <database> [<backend>]

DESCRIPTION
  mdb-schema is a utility program distributed with MDB Tools. 

  It produces DDL (data definition language) output for the given database. This can be passed to another database to create a replica of the original access table format.

OPTIONS
  -T <table>, --table <table>       Single table option.  Create schema for this table only. Default is to export all tables.
  --drop-table        Issue DROP TABLE statement.
  --no-drop-table     Don't issue DROP TABLE statement. This is the default.
  --not-null          Issue NOT NULL constraints. This is the default.
  --no-not-null       Don't issue NOT NULL constraints.
  --not-empty         Issue CHECK <> '' constraints.
  --no-not-empty      Don't issue CHECK <> '' constraints. This is the default.
  --indexes           Export INDEXes. This is the default.
  --no-indexes        Don't export INDEXes.
  --relations         Export foreign keys constraints. This is the default.
  --no-relations      Don't export foreign keys constraints.
  -S, --sanitize      Replace non alphanumric characters by underscore.
  --no-sanitize       Don't replace non alphanumric characters by underscore. This is the default.

  backend	Specifies target DDL dialect. Supported values are access, sybase, oracle, postgres, and mysql. If not specified the generated DDL will be in access format.

ENVIRONMENT
  MDB_JET3_CHARSET    Defines the charset of the input JET3 (access 97) file. Default is CP1252. See iconv(1).
  MDBICONV            Defines the output charset to use for the SQL file. Default is UTF-8. mdbtools must have been compiled with iconv.
  MDBOPTS             semi-column separated list of options:
                      * use_index
                      * no_memo
                      * debug_like
                      * debug_write
                      * debug_usage
                      * debug_ole
                      * debug_row
                      * debug_props
                      * debug_all is a shortcut for all debug_* options

BUGS
  Relationships and other features may not be supported by all databases.
  Access datatypes are mapped to their closest counterparts in the target backend. This may not always yield an exact fit.
