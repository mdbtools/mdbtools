NAME
  mdb-parsecsv - Convert CSV table dump into C file.

SYNOPSIS
  mdb-parsecsv file

DESCRIPTION
  mdb-parsecsv is a utility program distributed with MDB Tools.

  mdb-parsecsv takes a CSV file representing a database table, and converts
  it into a C array.

NOTES
  If the first argument does not exist as a file, mdb-parsecsv will look for
  the same filename with '.txt' appended.

  The file extension is stripped, and the output written to the base name
  plus a '.c' extension.

ENVIRONMENT
  MDB_JET3_CHARSET    Defines the charset of the input JET3 (access 97) file. Default is CP1252. See iconv(1).
  MDBICONV            Defines the output charset to use for the SQL file. Default is UTF-8. mdbtools must have been compiled with iconv.
  MDBOPTS             Colon-separated list of options:
                      * debug_like
                      * debug_write
                      * debug_usage
                      * debug_ole
                      * debug_row
                      * debug_props
                      * debug_all is a shortcut for all debug_* options
                      * no_memo (deprecated; has no effect)
                      * use_index (experimental; requires libmswstr)

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
  mdb-parsecsv is deprecated. Soon, it will no longer be distributed.

  It is the feeling of developers that it is not used, as C code generation
  is now usually replaced by more generic approaches, including libmdb calls
  and odbc.

  However, should you find this tool useful, drop us a line at
  https://github.com/mdbtools/mdbtools/issues/197
  and we'll consider maintaining it.
